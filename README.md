# Customer-Behaviour-Analysis-SQL

The data of this project can be found [here](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-1/). This project uses data from a study to look into what customers like and how they spend their money at a restaurant. We want to find out what food and deals customers enjoy most, how often they buy, and what we can do better with our menu or ads. The aim is to learn more about our customers' choices to make their dining experience even better.

## Problem Statement

Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they’ve spent and also which menu items are their favorite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalized experience for his loyal customers.
He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program - additionally he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL. Danny has provided you with a sample of his overall customer data due to privacy issues - but he hopes that these examples are enough for you to write fully functioning SQL queries to help him answer his questions!


### Observations

- Consistency in Top Sellers: It’s evident that Sushi, Curry, and Ramen remain the top-selling items both before and after the membership program. This suggests that the introduction of the membership program hasn’t significantly altered customers’ preferences for these menu items.
- Increase in Ramen Sales: Interestingly, there’s a noticeable increase in Ramen sales after the implementation of the membership program, rising from 2 to 5 sales. This could indicate that the membership program may have influenced customers to explore different menu options or increase their frequency of ordering.
- Steady Performance of Curry: Curry maintains consistent sales figures before and after the membership program, indicating that its popularity remains unaffected by the program.

#### Recommendations

- Menu Diversification: While the top-selling items are performing well, consider introducing new menu items or seasonal specials to diversify offerings and attract a broader customer base.
- Membership Program Benefits: Evaluate the effectiveness of the membership program in driving sales and customer loyalty. Consider enhancing the program with additional perks or incentives to further incentivize customer spending and participation.
